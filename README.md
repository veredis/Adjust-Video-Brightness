## About Fork
Backup of https://github.com/kxkx5150/Adjust-Video-Brightness with updated readme. Code is unchanged.

## Features:

- Adjust Brightness, Contrast, Saturation, Hue, Sepia, and Grayscale
- Adjust Playback Rate
- Create Picture in Picture window
- Works on many different sites including YouTube, Twitch, Vimeo, Odysee, and most other web-based video players

## Installation
The original extension seems to have been removed from the Chrome Web Store, probably due to a lack of updates. The extension still works great though, it just needs to be manually installed:

- Download repository .zip file: https://github.com/veredis/Adjust-Video-Brightness/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
- Extract to folder
- Go to chrome://extensions
- Turn on Developer Mode (top right)
- Click Load Unpacked (top left)
- Select extracted folder
